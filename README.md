# Surfs_Up
# Overview
On this project, we worked with a client to analyze weather data for the island of Oahu to see if it would make sense to open a surfing and ice cream shop. In order for our client to best understand the weather trends for this area, we will look at the months of June and December, which are some of the more dynamic weather months for Oahu. The goal will be to gather a summary of statistics and provide insight to potential investors and help them determine if opening up shop will be a sustainable investment.
