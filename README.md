# Surfs_Up
# Overview
On this project, we worked with a client to analyze weather data for the island of Oahu to see if it would make sense to open a surfing and ice cream shop. In order for our client to best understand the weather trends for this area, we will look at the months of June and December, which are some of the more dynamic weather months for Oahu. The goal will be to gather a summary of statistics and provide insight to potential investors and help them determine if opening up shop will be a sustainable investment.

Main takeaways: 
- We have one less year of data for December (2010-2016) than we do for June (2010-2017).
- June has an average low of 64F while December has an average low of 56F.
- December has a standard deviation of 3.76 while June has a standard deviation of 3.26. 

## Summary
In conclusion, Oahu is a tropical paradise with little temperature changes throughout the year. The average December temperature is 71F, which is significantly warmer to a lot of people who would likely be vacationing in Oahu from colder climates. Surfing rentals and sales should not be impacted much by these temperatures. However, ice cream sales may drop slightly during this time.

Additional information from further queries:

(1) Precipitation amounts data during the same years since rain will likely impact surfing sales.
(2) Find out where rain falls the most on the island and try and stay clear from those areas.
